# Day 7: Multi-Agent OKR Misalignment Detection System

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a multi-agent Agentic AI system to detect and correct misalignments between students' stated OKRs and their actual deliverables or reflections.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### 1. **OKR Parsing Agent** 
- **Purpose**: Extracts and structures declared goals and intended outcomes from student-submitted OKRs
- **Status**: Implemented in `rag_validator.py`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Parses resume content for 5-pillar framework validation
  - Identifies CLT, CFC, SCD, IIPC, and SRI pillars
  - Provides detailed descriptions of missing components

### 2. **Outcome Analyzer Agent** ⭐ (Main Focus)
- **Purpose**: Reviews submissions or reflection artifacts to identify what was actually delivered or learned
- **Status**: Fully implemented using AgentExecutor pattern
- **Location**: `outcome_analyzer.py`
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
  - Direct API integration (no LangChain parsing issues)
  - Optional Tavily web search integration

#### Tools Available:
1. **Content Analysis Tool**
   - Analyzes submission content for key outcomes and deliverables
   - Evaluates quality and alignment with stated goals
   - Identifies actual accomplishments vs. planned objectives

2. **Metrics Extraction Tool**
   - Extracts measurable outcomes and performance indicators
   - Identifies quantifiable results and specific achievements
   - Provides data-driven insights

3. **Learning Identification Tool**
   - Identifies key learnings and insights from submissions
   - Tracks new skills acquired and knowledge gained
   - Analyzes personal growth and challenges overcome

4. **Web Search Tool** (Optional)
   - Searches for additional context and best practices
   - Provides external validation and benchmarking
   - Enhances analysis with current industry standards

### 3. **Misalignment Detector Agent**
- **Purpose**: Compares goals and outcomes to flag vague, mismatched, or semantically drifted items
- **Status**: Integrated into the main analysis workflow
- **Functionality**: 
  - Detects gaps between stated objectives and actual deliverables
  - Identifies semantic drift (e.g., planning a build but submitting slides)
  - Provides specific misalignment examples

### 4. **Improvement Suggestion Agent** (RAG-Enabled)
- **Purpose**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to recommend better-aligned OKR examples
- **Status**: Web search integration implemented
- **Features**:
  - Searches for OKR best practices and examples
  - Provides strategic recommendations
  - Suggests improvement areas based on industry standards

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
