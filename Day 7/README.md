Goal

Create a multi-agent Agentic AI system to detect and correct misalignments between students' stated OKRs and their actual deliverables or reflections.

Agents

OKR Parsing Agent – Extracts and structures declared goals and intended outcomes from student-submitted OKRs.

Outcome Analyzer Agent – Reviews submissions or reflection artifacts to identify what was actually delivered or learned.

Misalignment Detector Agent – Compares goals and outcomes to flag vague, mismatched, or semantically drifted items (e.g., planning a build but submitting a slide deck).

Improvement Suggestion Agent (RAG-Enabled) – Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to recommend better-aligned OKR examples from a curated goal library.
